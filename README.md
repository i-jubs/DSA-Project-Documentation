# DSA- Excel Documentation
This is where i started my portfolio while taking my data analysis class with Incubator Hub using my excel project.

## Project Topic: DSA Data Analysis Capstone Project (Excel)
### Project overview
1. Ms excel: This data analysis Project aims at providing Insights for a company that provides e-commerce analytics solutions to sellers on platforms like Amazon. Analysis on product and customer review data is done to generate insights that can guide product improvement, marketing strategies, and customer engagement.
2. Power bi: This data analysis Project aims to analyse the company data and generate insights that the Palmoria management team would need to address.

### Data Sources
The Primary data source here is an Amazon Ms Excel Dataset and Palmoria management dataset which was provided by Incubator Hub for this Project.


### Tools Used
- Ms excel for data cleaning.
   - For data collection [Download Here](https://www.microsoft.com)
   - For data cleaning
      1. Data manipulation.
      2. Data munching.
- Power query for data transformation. [Download here](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=58494)
  - For data cleaning
  - Data manipulation
- Power bi for visualization

### Data Cleaning and Preparation

In the initial stage of the data cleaning and preparation, i did the following; 
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handling missing variables.
3. Data cleaning and formatting.

### Exploratory Data analysis (EDA)
#### Ms excel project
The following were the focus of this analysis;
1. What is the average discount percentage by product category?
2. How many products are listed under each category?
3. What is the total number of reviews per category?
4. Which products have the highest average ratings?
5. What is the average actual price vs the discounted price by category?
6. Which products have the highest number of reviews?
7. How many products have a discount of 50% or more?
8. What is the distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0, 4.0, etc.)?
9. What is the total potential revenue (actual_price × rating_count) by category?
10. What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., <₹200, ₹200–₹500, >₹500)?
11. How does the rating relate to the level of discount?
12. How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews?
13. Which categories have products with the highest discounts?
14. Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined.

### Data Analysis
This is where i include some basic lines of code and functions used during my analysis.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
#### Power bi
The following were the focus of this analysis;
1. What is the gender distribution in the organization? Distil to regions and departments
2. Show insights on ratings based on gender
3. Analyse the company’s salary structure. Identify if there is a gender pay gap. If there is, identify the department and regions that should be the focus of management
4. A recent regulation was adopted which requires manufacturing companies to pay employees a minimum of $90,000
  -  Does Palmoria meet this requirement?
  - Show the pay distribution of employees grouped by a band of $10,000. For example: How many employees fall into a band of $10,000 – $20,000, $20,000 – $30,000, etc.?
  - Also visualize this by regions.
5.  Allocate the annual bonus pay to employees based on the performance rating. He handed you another data set that contains rules for making bonus payments and asked you to:
  - Calculate the amount to be paid as a bonus to individual employees
  - Calculate the total amount to be paid to individual employees (salary inclusive of bonus)
  - Total amount to be paid out per region and company-wide

### Analysis
There is a noticeable gap between genders in palmoria group; both in their number and the amount of their salary. The following files contain inferences from this company employee dataset.
